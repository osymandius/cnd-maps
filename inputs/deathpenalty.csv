Indonesia,for,"<p>We would reiterate our concern on the INCB position on the issue of capital punishment; it goes beyond the INCB mandate. The suggestion that the death penalty breaches international standards is not right. Article 6, para 2, is clear about countries imposing death penalty for most serious crimes. The serious nature of the crime is clear when it comes to drug trafficking, because it affects the health and welfare of human beings and the fabric of society. The increasing trend in this crime also threatens sovereignty. The abolition of the death penalty is not an international customary law obligation. </p><a href='http://cndblog.org/2020/03/plenary-item-5-implementation-of-the-international-drug-control-treaties/'>Statement in context</a>"
