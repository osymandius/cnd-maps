# CND Maps

* Download the repository as a zip: https://github.com/osymandius/cnd-maps/archive/master.zip
* Open `cndmaps.Rproj` in RStudio. This will set the working directory to the right folder, no matter where you've unzipped it. This should get around any direct file path issues that we were facing before.
* Note the output folder
  - Exists already - R won't create a folder if you tell it write a file to a file path that includes folder that doesn't yet exist
  - Is empty
* Run `CND_maps.R`
* Bask in the glory of yet another year's CND, sticking it to the surprisingly lippy Sudan.
